Order of excetion - O(No of rows in the sheet) * No of Sheets

Time taken on the test file over all the sheets - < 2 minutes

Time taken on the main file over all the sheets - About 30 minutes

Extra feature:
A section would be added if any of the ticker has an opening value = 0
To handle problems caused by division by zero, %change of those tickers will be dispalyed as 0%
However, such a case didn't happen yet in testing

Also, this solution doesn't need the data to be sorted. It can work on data of any order

Please note that due to the library limitations on MAC (vba scripting runtime), more sophisticated datatypes like dictionaries were not used.
